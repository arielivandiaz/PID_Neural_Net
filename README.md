# PID Neural Net

Implementation of a PID Controller driven by a Neural Net with a 2-3-1 structure. The repository consists of the Octave Proof of concept, as well as the C++ Implementation and Visualization of the Neural Net in Action. Keep in mind this is for specific applications and might not work in all cases. Some inoput functions and combinations of weights might create an unstable system, and require some tweaking.
